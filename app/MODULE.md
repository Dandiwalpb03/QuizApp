#Module AppModule
This file have all the dependencies which will be provided to the Hilt DI System. 
We are using Hilt to manage our Dependencies rather than doing manually which is very complicated. 
But now we have to tell the Hilt which dependencies to manage.
This AppModule doing that job for us, here we are dumping in a clean and standardised way.
